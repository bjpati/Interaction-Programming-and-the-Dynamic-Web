# Interaction-Programming-and-the-Dynamic-Web

Interaction programming gives the basic Model-View-Controller principles for developing interactive applications. These principles can be applied to many desktop, mobile or web apps frameworks. The course currently applies these principles to web applications, using JavaScript, DOM APIs, HTML, CSS etc. These front-end applications use data from remote back-ends using web APIs.

## Course contents
* JavaScript for interaction programming, callbacks, synchronous and asynchronous code, functional programming.
* Web development interfaces (API): REST, JSON, AJAX, Fetch, Promises.
* Local data: cookies, local storage.
* User interfaces, appearance: HTML, CSS, DOM API, other tree based frameworks for user interfaces (e g Android).
* User interfaces, interaction: events, event levels, event propagation, event management.
* User interfaces, architectures: Model-View-Controller.
* User interfaces, frameworks: React, Angular, Vue.

## Learning outcomes
Having passed the course, the student will be able to

* choose appropriate technical platforms or JavaScript frameworks to create useful data persistent interactive web applications or native applications
* program interactive web applications according to Model-View-Controller or related architectures
* program systems that read data from, and send data to, web interfaces with good use qualities
* assess and improve the usability of existing interactive web applications
* cooperate with others to implement interactive web applications.
